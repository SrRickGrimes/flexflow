# FlexFlox Workflow Engine built with C#

## Overview
This workflow engine is a powerful and flexible tool designed to create, manage, and execute complex workflows in a modular and extensible manner. It provides a fluent interface for defining workflows, allowing for clear and intuitive workflow definitions.

## Key Features

### 1. Modular Workflow Construction
- **StartWith**: Initiates the workflow with a specified step.
- **Then**: Chains subsequent steps in the workflow.

### 2. Branching and Conditional Logic
- **Branch**: Allows the workflow to diverge based on conditions, with separate paths for true and false outcomes.
- **If**: Provides a simplified conditional branching for scenarios with only a 'true' branch.

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
- **Catch**: Captures and handles specific exceptions, allowing for graceful error management.
- **Retry**: Automatically retries failed steps a specified number of times with a configurable delay between attempts.

### 4. Iterative Processing
- **While**: Enables repetitive execution of a set of steps while a condition is met.

### 5. Data Transformation
- **Map**: Allows for transformation of the workflow's output data.

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- **WithLogging**: Integrates logging capabilities into the workflow for better visibility and debugging.

### 7. Composability
- **SubWorkflow**: Supports nesting of workflows, allowing for complex workflow compositions.

### 8. Asynchronous Execution
- All steps in the workflow support asynchronous operations, leveraging `Task<Result<T>>` for results.

### 9. Dependency Injection Support
- **IWorkflowStep Interface**: Supports creation of individual workflow steps as separate classes, enabling dependency injection and promoting better separation of concerns.

## Usage Example

```csharp
public class SampleWorkflow : IWorkflow<Input, Output>
{
    private readonly IStepOne _stepOne;
    private readonly IStepTwo _stepTwo;

    public SampleWorkflow(IStepOne stepOne, IStepTwo stepTwo)
    {
        _stepOne = stepOne;
        _stepTwo = stepTwo;
    }

    public void Build(IWorkflowBuilder<Input, Output> builder)
    {
        builder
            .StartWith(_stepOne.Execute)
            .Then(_stepTwo.Execute)
            .Branch(
                condition: CheckCondition,
                trueBranch: branch => branch.Then(TrueBranchStep),
                falseBranch: branch => branch.Then(FalseBranchStep)
            )
            .Catch<CustomException>(HandleException)
            .Retry(3, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
            .While(ShouldContinue, loopBuilder => loopBuilder.Then(LoopStep))
            .Map(TransformResult)
            .WithLogging(logger);
    }
    
    // Other step implementations...
}

public interface IStepOne : IWorkflowStep<Input, IntermediateResult> { }
public interface IStepTwo : IWorkflowStep<IntermediateResult, Output> { }

public class StepOne : IStepOne
{
    public Task<Result<IntermediateResult>> Execute(Input input)
    {
        // Step implementation
    }
}

public class StepTwo : IStepTwo
{
    public Task<Result<Output>> Execute(IntermediateResult input)
    {
        // Step implementation
    }
}
```

## Functional Approach

This workflow engine adopts a functional programming approach, which offers several benefits:

1. **Immutability**: Each step in the workflow is designed to be a pure function, taking an input and producing an output without side effects. This makes the workflow more predictable and easier to reason about.

2. **Composability**: The functional approach allows for easy composition of workflow steps. Complex workflows can be built by combining simpler, reusable steps.

3. **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test as they always produce the same output for a given input, regardless of external state.

4. **Parallelism**: The absence of shared mutable state makes it easier to parallelize parts of the workflow when appropriate.

5. **Error Handling**: The use of `Result<T>` as a return type for each step provides a clean way to handle and propagate errors throughout the workflow.

## Use Cases

This workflow engine is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios. Here are some potential use cases:

1. **Order Processing Systems**: 
   - Handle complex order fulfillment processes including inventory checks, payment processing, and shipping.
   - Use branching to manage different types of orders or shipping methods.
   - Implement retry logic for external service calls (e.g., payment gateways).

2. **Document Approval Workflows**:
   - Model multi-step approval processes with conditional branches based on document type or approval level.
   - Use the `While` feature to implement revision cycles.
   - Leverage sub-workflows for department-specific approval steps.

3. **Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes**:
   - Create workflows for data extraction from various sources, transformation, and loading into target systems.
   - Use the `Map` feature for data transformation steps.
   - Implement error handling and retries for network-related operations.

4. **Customer Onboarding**:
   - Model the customer registration process, including form validation, credit checks, and account setup.
   - Use branching to handle different customer types or service levels.
   - Implement KYC (Know Your Customer) processes as sub-workflows.

5. **IoT Device Management**:
   - Create workflows for device provisioning, firmware updates, and telemetry processing.
   - Use retry logic to handle intermittent connectivity issues.
   - Implement branching for different device types or firmware versions.

6. **Financial Trading Systems**:
   - Model complex trading strategies as workflows.
   - Use branching for different market conditions.
   - Implement risk checks and approvals as separate workflow steps.

7. **Content Publishing Pipelines**:
   - Create workflows for content creation, review, approval, and publishing processes.
   - Use the `While` feature for revision cycles.
   - Implement different sub-workflows for various content types (articles, videos, podcasts).

8. **HR Processes**:
   - Model employee onboarding, performance review, or offboarding processes.
   - Use branching for different departments or employee levels.
   - Implement document generation steps using the `Map` feature.

These use cases demonstrate the flexibility and power of the workflow engine. Its functional approach and rich feature set make it adaptable to a wide range of business processes across various industries.
